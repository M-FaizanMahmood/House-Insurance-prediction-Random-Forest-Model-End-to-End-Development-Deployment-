This project involves building and deploying a Random Forest model for house insurance prediction, achieving 96% accuracy & R-squared of 0.8499. The model is trained on a dataset containing seven key features: age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, region, and charges, charges as the target variable, A Gradio interface was developed for users to input details and receive real-time predictions. The model is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for public access.

**Key Tasks:**
**Data Visualization:** In-depth analysis using pair plots and box plots to understand data distribution and relationships.
**Data Cleaning:** Outliers were capped instead of removed to retain data integrity.
**Feature Engineering & Correlation Analysis:** A correlation matrix was created to assess feature importance.
**Encoding & Scaling:** Data was one-hot encoded using get_dummies, and standardized using a scaler saved as **"insurance_scaler2.pkl"** for future predictions.
The final preprocessed dataset was saved as **"insurance_processed.csv"** for use in the machine learning pipeline.

**key Tasks:**
**Machine Learning Model Creation:** The cleaned dataset ("insurance_processed.csv") was used to build a Random Forest Regressor model for predicting insurance charges.

**Model Selection:** A Random Forest Regressor with 100 estimators was chosen due to its ability to handle non-linearity, capture feature interactions, measure feature importance, resist overfitting, and efficiently scale with data.

**Model Evaluation:**
Mean Squared Error: 17,538,480.31
R-squared: 0.8499

**Model Validation:** The model was cross-validated with user inputs for prediction accuracy.
**User Interface & Deployment:** A Gradio interface was developed for real-time predictions, and the model was saved as **insurance_model2.pkl** for future use

# **File Title : Insurance_Model_Gradio.ipynb**

This file of the project contains a user interface which was built using the Gradio library, that allows users to input their detailsâ€”such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, and region. These inputs are then scaled and encoded using predefined parameters and the saved scaler "insurance_scaler2.pkl".

The system processes the inputs through the Random Forest Regressor model and provides an estimated prediction of the user's insurance charges. The interface allows for seamless interaction and real-time estimation of insurance costs based on the provided information.

# **File Title : app.py**

This file contains the deployment script for the Random Forest Regressor model, which is hosted on Hugging Face Spaces. The script runs the Gradio-based user interface, allowing users to input their details (age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, and region) and receive an estimated insurance charge. The app uses the saved model **insurance_model2.pkl** and the scaler **insurance_scaler2.pkl** to process the inputs and generate real-time predictions. The model is deployed for public access, offering seamless interaction for predicting insurance costs.
